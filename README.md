# Werks_Tally
Utility that parses a facility log into the number of completed projects in the game Foxhole. Used for tracking contribution to the Foxhole war effort for facilities.

# How to use:
1. Enter a facility log and use an OCR utility like PowerToys Text Extractor or Win11's Snipping Tool's "Copy all text" feature.
2. Copy the resulting text into the textbox to the left. Repeat and append the text from all the facilities you wish to parse the Werks from.
3. Press the "Process raw data" button.
4. After checking the results, press the "Save data" button. The results are saved in a Txt file which is opened after saving, as well as a CSV file you can open with your sheet editor of choice.

Note: The results are appended in the files, so if you save the same data multiple times, you will have duplicates.
